#  be used to build an AOK-Filesystems-Tools Debian10 image
#
#  This populates the Debian image to have as far as possible, the
#  same things installed, as would be on an Alpine deploy.
#
#  Since adding the default software during deploy in a Debian running
#  inside iSH is quite slow, for Debian everything is installed by
#  default, so items not wanted will have to instead be removed.
