#  Environment variables defining how this AOK-FS should be setup
#

#
#  Variables used during build.
#  Recomended is to copy this file to .AOK_VARS and make changes there.
#  This file will be ignored by git, and overrides this file. It also
#  minimizes risk of temp changes to become unintentionally permanent.
#  Only when you think a change should be saved into git, put it here!
#

#
#  Label for AOK builds, is also displayed by motd to indicate what
#  AOK FS release is being used
#
AOK_VERSION="0.19.16b"

#
#  If defined this will be created as a no-password sudo capable user
#
USER_NAME="ish"

#
#  Shell for account USER_NAME (if defined).
#  If USER_NAME is defined root will also use this shell by default,
#  to make sudo / switching user more convenient
#
USER_SHELL="/bin/bash"

#
#  If you want to hard-code timezone, the FS will be setup without
#  giving the option to select time-zone.
#  During testing its a convenient thing to set, not having to select
#  a TZ for every install.
#
# AOK_TIMEZONE="Europe/Berlin"

#
#  cron (dcron for Alpine), will allaways be installed
#  /etc/periodic placeholders will be created and a root crontab
#  running the periodics will be put in place.
#  The service will only be enabled if USE_CRON_SERVICE is set to "Y"
#  Otherwise theese settings have no impact on performance.
#  You can always decide later to activate the service.
#
# USE_CRON_SERVICE="Y"

#
#  Replaces /root and USER_NAME home dirs with pre-defined content
#  If USER_NAME is not set HOME_DIR_USER will be ignored.
#
# HOME_DIR_USER="/iCloud/ish_config/home_user.tgz"
# HOME_DIR_ROOT="/iCloud/ish_config/home_root.tgz"

#
#  If you want to manually add something to the new FS, before deploy
#  begins. Remember that from the outside, the new FS is located at
#  $TMPDIR/aok_fs, if TMPDIR is undefined it defaults to /tmp
#  I use this when I want to simulate a mounted /iCloud env like what I
#  would have on my iPad, whilst testing the FS on a Linux build host
#  If the FS is being compressed its /iCloud is first cleared, so
#  anything you put in /iCloud will only be available for chrooted
#  sessions on the build host.
#  If you put stuff in locations other than /iCloud it will be
#  kept in the compressed FS
#
# POPULATE_FS="rsync -ah /home/jaclu/iCloud $TMPDIR/aok_fs"

#
#  Additional tasks done during the prebuild stage, ie on the build
#  platform. Make sure nothing depends on the destination env!
#
# PREBUILD_ADDITIONAL_TASKS="/iCloud/deploy/additional-prebuild-tasks"

#
#  Use this if you have your own restore procedure.
#  If defined, this will be run after deploy has completed, at a time
#  when it should be running inside a full AOK FS
#  If this is a script, it must be available with this PATH on the new
#  FS, that means it most likely needs to be in the iCloud mount.
#  Unless you have used POPULATE_FS to insert it into the regular FS
#
# FIRST_BOOT_ADDITIONAL_TASKS="/iCloud/deploy/additional-tasks"

#                   Hostname handling
#
########################################################################

#
#  Since iOS 17.0 iSH is no longer able to provide hostname at startup.
#  If this is set to /etc/hostname, its content will only be displayed,
#  and that file needs to be manually changed.
#  Any other path would be asumed to be a sync file, written to by an iOS
#  shortcut providing current hostname. The last line of this file will
#  be copied to /etc/hostname when /usr/local/bin/hostname is run with -U
#  If this is not defined, no hostname syncing will happen, and
#  /etc/hostname will be used as a static hostname.
#  During the final deploy step a hostname will be requested.
#  It can be changed later by following the instructions listed by: hostname -h
#
# ALT_HOSTNAME_SOURCE_FILE="/iCloud/temp/hostname_by_shortcut.txt"

#
#  If you run both iSH-AOK and regular iSH on the same device
#  this setting modifies the hostname for aok kernels to have -aok suffix
#  So my iPad JacPad would be calling itself JacPad-aok if you check
#  `hostname` on iSH-AOK and JacPad if you check on regular iSH
#  This feature also works for iOS >= 17
#

#
#  sudo insta-crashes iSH if using Alpine >= 3.19... last checked 2024-07-02

#  AOK installs an older sudo (Alpine 3.18) on such releases, this

#
#  For edge releases - Current development tree
#  Format is the isodate featured in the minirootfs filename
